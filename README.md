# SQL Query Syntax
This project contains various SQL queries that demonstrate a wide range of functions which I hope will convey my passion
and dedication for working with data. It truly is a passion! Understanding the data with data types, relationships, object
structures, stored procedures, triggers, etc. is what I thoroughly enjoy so that I can then find the most efficient way to
get the data results in the desired format. From use of Common Table Expressions to in memory temp tables to use of cursors,
subqueries, xml parsing, string manipulation, pivot/unpivot and the most powerful of all... dynamice queries. I'm confident
these SQL queries will demonstrate my innovation and solid understanding of advanced SQL to create efficiencies, avoid risk,
and ultimately to enable people to be successful!
